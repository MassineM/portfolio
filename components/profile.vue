        "Ambition is key to foul the odds"
        <br>
        ~ Massine Mountasser, 22 years old, computer science engineering student
        <br>
        "Being a student in the Littoral Côte d’Opale's engineering school of informatics,
         I am looking forward to enrich my career starting by enrolling to an internship,"
          says the ambitious young man. "I believe it would help me discover my full potential
           in real situations and that's fine by me, for how big my love for challenge is..."

        ~ Born in Agadir on may 13th of 1999, I have always managed to get myself amazed by any technology I came across. Playing with electronics as a child, coding mini games in early teenage years, enrolling to mechanic studies in highschool...
<br>
~ When I got my baccalaureate in mechanical techs and sciences, it seemed like I was destined to take a step back and study many more technical, scientific and litterary domains.
<br>
~ I spent the next two years in preparatory classes for engineering schools - industrial technologies and sciences branch (CPGE TSI). Once done with all of the orientation and school acceptance contests, I was more than happy to join the Littoral Côte d'Opale's engineering school of information technologies, with which I still am today.
<br>
~ This leads us to the main purpose of this website I made while personally practicing web development: I'm still looking for an internship with some company that wants some profile in computer science near mine, and with whom I'd learn about real workspaces organisation and methods.
